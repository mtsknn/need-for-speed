# Need for Speed

## Development mode

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open <http://localhost:3000/>
4. In Atom,
   press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
   and select "Chlorine: Connect Socket Repl"
   and "Chlorine: Connect Embedded"
   - Now you can evaluate code in Atom e.g. with
     [Chlorine's example keybindings](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine/blob/master/README.md#keybindings)

## Building for production

1. `npm run build`

Set up the project.

Got distracted looking for a nice Clojure IDE.

Previously I have used [Cursive IDE](https://cursive-ide.com/)
when doing
[Clojure exercises on Exercism](https://mtsknn.fi/weekly-log/2021/11/#clojure-exercises-on-exercism).
Cursive uses Paredit for "structural editing."
I'm sure it's very handy and useful,
but it seems too much of a hassle to set up,
especially as I'm also using IdeaVim (Vim plugin).

I think I'll try:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (code editor)
- vim-mode-plus (Vim plugin)
- Chlorine (Clojure REPL plugin)
- [Parinfer](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/)
  (plugin which simplifies writing and editing Lisp code like Clojure).

Finished configuring Atom for now.
So far so good!

Also [asked about Reagent template's license file](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template/issues/182).

Committed this readme file.
(I have been writing and updating this during the whole time.)
